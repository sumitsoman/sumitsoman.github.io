Abstract: A method performed by a node for handling drift in data. The node obtains a dataset comprising a plurality of datapoints corresponding to a plurality of values of one or more dependent variables for a plurality of first features over a time period. The node determines, using machine learning and explainability, in the absence of determining whether or not the plurality of datapoints has a drift, whether or not there has been a change in respective one or more characteristics of a subset of the plurality of first features having a largest contribution to a variability of the datapoints in the plurality of datapoints based on a threshold from a first time period to a second time period. The node then initiates application of a drift policy on the plurality of datapoints based on a result of the determination.
