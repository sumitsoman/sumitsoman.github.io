Abstract: A computer-implemented method, performed by a first node, for handling location of a network node in a geographical area for operation in a communications system. The first node obtains first data indicating images of the geographical area over a first time period. The first node also obtains second data indicating data samples of performance indicators of radio communications, during the first time period, of devices in the geographical area. The first node determines, by performing a spatio-temporal correlation of the obtained first data and the obtained second data, one or more locations as candidates to place the network node for operation in the communications system. The determining is performed using machine learning or deep learning, and. The first node then outputs an indication of the determined one or more locations.
