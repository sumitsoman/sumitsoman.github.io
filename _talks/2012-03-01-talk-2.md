Abstract: A method performed in a network node includes performing drift detection in a slice to identify a number of data points in drift in at least one of network specific performance parameters and/or user equipment, UE, specific performance parameters. The method includes obtaining weighting parameters of the network and UE specific performance parameters. The method includes combining a function of data points in drift of the network and UE specific performance parameters with each data point of the number of data points in drift weighed by the weighting parameters associated with data point. The method includes determining one or more service level agreement, SLA, violations as a weighted average of individual drift in one or more of the at least one of network specific performance parameters and UE specific performance parameters. The method includes performing an action based on determining the one or more SLA violations.
