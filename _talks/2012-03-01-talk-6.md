Abstract: A computer-implemented method of identifying sequences of machine learning (ML) models of a plurality of ML models during a training phase is provided. The method comprises generating (301) one or more sequences of the ML models The method further comprises determining (302) a performance of each sequence of the ML models. Furthermore, the method comprises identifying (303) a sequence with performance greater than a threshold performance.
