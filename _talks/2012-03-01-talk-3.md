Abstract: A computer-implemented method, performed by a first node, for handling predictive models. The first node updates, using machine learning, a first predictive model of an indicator of performance of the communications system. The updating is based on respective explainability values respectively obtained from a first subset of a plurality of second nodes. The respective explainability values correspond to a first subset of respective second predictive models of the indicator of performance of the communications system (100), respectively determined by the first subset of the plurality of second nodes. The models in the first subset of respective second predictive models have a respective performance value above a threshold. The first node then provides an indication of the updated first predictive model to a third node comprised in the plurality of second nodes and excluded from the first subset, or to another node.
