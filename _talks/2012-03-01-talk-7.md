Abstract: A computer-implemented method performed by a first node (111). The methods is for planning radio coverage in a space (170). The first node (111) operates in a communications system (100). The first node (111) determines (204), using machine learning (ML) and first radio coverage data from one or more first communications networks (120), an ML model. The ML model is to estimate a number of one or more radio antennas (142) necessary to provide radio coverage to the space (170). The estimate is to be performed in the absence of a floor plan corresponding to the space (170). The first node (111) also provides (208) an indication of the determined ML model to a second node (112) operating in the computer system (100).
