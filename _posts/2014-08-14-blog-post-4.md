5G non-standalone access (NSA) serves as a natural progression from LTE to a 5G upgrade. Combining user experience with data-driven insights can help achieve an optimal balance between enhanced user satisfaction and signaling costs, positioning 5G NSA as an effective intermediate step between LTE and standalone 5G. This approach supports technology leadership while keeping 5G standalone deployment as the ultimate goal.
