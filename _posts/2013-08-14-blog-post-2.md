Time-critical communication or Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (uRLLC) was envisioned as one of the fundamental use case categories in 5G network architecture. Stringent requirements on latency and reliability might require several provisions, such as robust and duplicate transmission, a method where devices can access transmission resources without prior permission, and prescheduling. These provisions, while helping to achieve optimal performance, have an impact on resource utilization. We explore and discuss how a cognitive duplication approach could be used to find a trade-off between performance and resource utilization.
